# AI-VitalSign-Trend-Detection
AI-based early detection of abnormal vital sign trends for preventive healthcare
# AI-Based Vital Sign Trend Detection Assistant

This repository contains the working prototype developed as part of the 1M1B – AI for Sustainability Virtual Internship (in collaboration with IBM SkillsBuild & AICTE).

## Project Overview
The project focuses on early detection of abnormal trends in patient vital signs such as heart rate, blood pressure, oxygen saturation, and temperature. The AI system analyzes time-series data and provides early warning alerts to support preventive healthcare.

## SDG Alignment
- SDG 3: Good Health and Well-Being
- SDG 9: Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure
- SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production

## Technologies Used
- Prompt Engineering
- IBM watsonx.ai (Granite Models)
- Agentic AI workflow
